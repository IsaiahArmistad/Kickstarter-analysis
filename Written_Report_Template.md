# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louise is close to her fundraising goal for her play *Fever*, and wants to know other campaigns fared based their launch dates and funding goals.
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to sort through the entire data set of projects to find the relevant information of theater outcomes based on when they were created and what their funding goals are. To complete this project, we had to learn and correctly use pivot tables, *countifs()* functions, and *sum()* functions. 
## Analysis and Challenges
One challenge for me was getting the correct formulas for the *countif()* functions. I was getting the first function correctly, but when I would try to auto fill the rest of the cells in, something would go wrong. So I had to input each cell's function manually to get a result. 
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
One conclusion is is that most October has the highest percentage of failed theater projects. Another conclusion is that plays are most successful in May, June, and July.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
From the *Outcomes based on Goals*, we can conclude that a play is more likely to be succeed the less it cost. 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
A limitation of this data set is the fact that we cannot look at the genres of plays like we could with music genres. This could give Louise an even clearer picture about why a play may fail. Maybe certain genres are more popular at certain times of the year, but we can't see the specifics of the play genres. 
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
From this data set, we could also show tables and graphs that showed the other projects did during each month of the year. We could also see what percentage of projects were properly funded and what percentage were underfunded.
